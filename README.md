# sorting
This is a node project to aid me in my studies of algorithms from the book
Algorithms 4th Edition, by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

I've started with the sorting algorithms in chapter 2. I am rewriting the
algorithms into modern, ES6 Javascript.

The code that you see at any given time isn't great, and I will be refactoring
it often.

This is primarily for my own study efforts.
